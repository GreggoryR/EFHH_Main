  - You like my music? I like to collect albums. I was a hostess for a very prominent
    club back in the day.
  - 'After I got married, I was forbidden from working there anymore as my new family
    was too proud. '
  - 'They never did like me. But at least my sweet husband did. '
  - "At the club, we would drink and smoke all the time, but I\u2019ve lost my appetite
    for any type of alcohol. "
  - I do love smoking, though. The warm feeling in my chest. It takes me back to
    those late nights when it felt like time would never end.
  - "If only I had a lighter or some matches. At least then I\u2019d be able to smoke
    next to the window\u2026"
