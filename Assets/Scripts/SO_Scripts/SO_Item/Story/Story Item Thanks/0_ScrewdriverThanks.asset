  thanks:
  - 'You found it! '
  - It looks like I got my color back...
  - That's weird...
  - The aliens must have taken our color...
  - Does hope bring it back? Happiness?
  - I don't know. That sounds dumb.
  - Well, if you want to help us get out of here...
  - I need you to go around Happy Homes...
  - ...looking for items to help me build my catapult.
  - Why can't I just do it?
  - I...uh, well, you see...the aliens...they know I'm special...
  - If they take me...we've lost all hope...
  - ...and I'm too afraid.
  - Can you please?
  - I need you to find me a wheel!
  - Last I heard, Barry, the grumpy dick in the room next to you, has one.
  - And if you find any nachos...
  - I wouldn't mind if you brought me some...
