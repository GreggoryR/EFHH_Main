  thanks:
  - Wow, he actually gave you the wheel.
  - They got their colors back, too?
  - Shits weird.
  - The aliens here...they've been doing this...
  - ...for longer than you might expect.
  - When I get out, I have to go back to my laboratory.
  - There's something there that will end all of this...
  - But for now, we need to get out of here.
  - Can you find me an oxygen tank for the canon?
  - Canon? I mean catapult. Yes? Yes!
  - I saw one somewhere in the top hallway.
  - Take this key card.
  - It will give you access.
  - Good luck.
