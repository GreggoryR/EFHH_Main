  thanks:
  - Nice, that will really help with the laser canon.
  - 'I''m sorry? No, you said laser canon. '
  - 'I said catapult. '
  - The next item is going to be tricky to get.
  - You'll need to find a way into the basement.
  - The elevator has a keypad...
  - ...but I can't remember the code.
