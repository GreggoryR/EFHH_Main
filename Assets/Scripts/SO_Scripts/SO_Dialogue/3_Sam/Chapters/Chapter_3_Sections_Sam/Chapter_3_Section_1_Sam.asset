  - Oh, Bishop sent you for the elevator code?
  - I hope this plan of his works out. We weren't supposed to be here that long.
  - I heard the nurses talking about the code the other day.
  - One of them said to another...
  - '"It changed. Sam''s TV. Only on."'
  - 'Whatever that means. '
  - 'I can''t turn on my TV because they took my remote. '
  - I think they put it in a drawer somewhere.
  - If you find it, you'll be able to turn on my TV and see what channels are on.
  - Good luck and I'll see you on the other side.
