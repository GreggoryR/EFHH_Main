  - One of the best memories I have at the club...
  - ...involved a very large man with a belly that went past his waist.
  - There was a stage where paid performers would dance and sing.
  - But that day, the large man decided, against everyone's wishes, to go on stage
    and perform.
  - He stood there--the music had stopped--the stage light shining on him with this
    huge shadow behind him.
  - There was only silence.
  - 'And then...he sang. '
  - 'And it wasn''t your normal type of singing. '
  - It was the most beautiful singing anyone at the club had heard.
  - 'Everyone stared in shock but listend with pure amazement. '
  - When he finished, he was drenched in sweat. His chest heaving from being out
    of breath.
  - 'And then, just like that, everyone started clapping and cheering. '
  - His face was bright red. He was smiling from ear to ear. Probably from the alcohol
    but also pride.
  - After that, everyone from the crowd wanted to go on stage and sing.
  - It felt like in that moment, sharing that experience, everyone became a family.
  - 'We sang, drank, and danced until morning. '
  - I'll cherish those memories.
